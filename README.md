Hello!

I'm Teo (comes from Teodoros -in Greek meaning God's Gift-) and currently im an undergraduate student
in the compartment of Applied Informatics.

I had a love for computers since when I remember myself. Particularly I had a love for games. I was
getting imersed by the graphics, the storyteling, the music and in general everything that made a game
what is. From then I had an aspiration to become a Game Developer and create games that would make other
kids (like I once was) love the games like I once did.

For now I am currently reading for my Uni, meanwhile working on some 2D Projects on Unity Engine.
